# SummerSchool2025

## Overview  
This project implements a **virtual orchestra synchronizable to any music**, transforming an audio input into a **music-synchronized animated video**.  
The visualization is **procedurally generated** using only geometric primitives (triangles) and reacts to the music being played.

---

## Features  
- **Input:**  
  - Accepts a `.mp3` file as input.  
  - Supports **maximum 2 instruments** (currently: **piano** & **trumpet**).  
  - Implemented using **Python** and standard libraries.

- **Output:**   
  - Live **music-synchronized animation**.  
  - Visualization designed with **Pygame**.  

- **Animation Characteristics:**  
  - Only **triangles** used as graphical primitives.  
  - Fully **procedural content** (no external images, textures, or video files).  
  - **Animated**: shapes move over time and react to specific notes.  
  - **Synchronized with music**: effects occur in sync with the score.

## Technical Details

### System Architecture
- **Audio Processing**: 
  - FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) analysis for frequency detection
  - Instrument differentiation between piano and trumpet
  - MIDI conversion capabilities for precise note timing

- **Visual Generation**:
  - Procedural mountain generation that reacts to trumpet notes
  - Procedural ground generation that reacts to piano notes
  - Dynamic sun that reacts to the music's tempo
  - Physics-based particle behavior with gravitational forces

- **Synchronization**:
  - Real-time music-to-visual mapping
  - Tempo-aware animation adjustments
  - Note velocity affecting visual intensity

### Core Components
- **`FFT.py`**: Analyzes audio files using Fast Fourier Transform to extract frequency data
- **`Particles.py`**: Physics engine for particle generation and movement
- **`Mountain_Generation.py`** & **`Sun_Generation.py`**: Procedural visual elements that react to music
- **`main.py`**: Central orchestration of all components and pygame visualization

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Pygame
- NumPy
- SciPy
- pretty_midi
- PyAudio
- Matplotlib
- FFmpeg (for audio conversion)

### FFmpeg Installation

This project requires the **FFmpeg** tool for audio conversion.  
Make sure FFmpeg is installed on your system and its executable is accessible in the `PATH` environment variable.

#### Installation on Windows

1. Download FFmpeg from [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or [https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/).
2. Extract the downloaded archive.
3. Add the folder containing `ffmpeg.exe` to the `PATH` environment variable:
   - Open **Advanced System Settings**.
   - Click on **Environment Variables**.
   - Edit the `PATH` variable and add the path to the FFmpeg `bin` folder.
4. Restart your terminal or IDE.

To verify the installation, run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
  ffmpeg -version
```

#### Installation on MacOS
1. Open the terminal.
2. Install Homebrew if it is not already installed by following the instructions at [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/).
3. Install FFmpeg by running the following command:
```bash
  brew install ffmpeg
```
4. To verify the installation, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
  ffmpeg -version
```

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SummerSchool2025.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare your audio files:
   - Place your `.mp3` files in the `media/mp3/` directory
   - Ensure they contain primarily piano and trumpet instruments for optimal results

---

## Usage

### Basic Operation
1. Run the main application:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```

2. The system will:
   - Process the audio file specified in the code
   - Generate visualizations synchronized to the music
   - Display the result in a Pygame window
   - Save the output as an MP4 video file

### Customization
- Edit `main.py` to change input files and visual parameters
- Adjust threshold values in `FFT.py` for different audio sensitivity
- Modify particle behavior in `Particles.py` for different visual effects

---

## MIDI Comparison Tools

The project includes MIDI comparison functionality through `MidiComparison.py`:

- Analyzes similarities between MIDI files using Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm
- Provides visual representation of note progressions and common patterns
- Useful for comparing generated MIDI outputs with original compositions

---

## Examples

The repository includes sample media files for testing:
- `Ecossaise_Beethoven.midi` and `PinkPanther.midi` for MIDI reference
- Pre-processed audio files in `.mp3` and `.wav` formats
- Examples of the visual output in the video files
